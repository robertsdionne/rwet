# Description:
#
#   One branching plant that takes up the lower 3/4 of the page.
#
#     Root: two dark-painted potato-shaped tubers next to the stem,
#       with a few medium-length "mousetail" roots shooting from them.
#     Stem: straight and vertical, light under(?)color, with a fantastic
#       loop at the top. The stem's base is wrapped with a short uncolored
#       sheath.
#     Branches: several, diagonal, mostly straight.
#     Leaves: four lobes with serrated edges, naturalistically curved.
#       each lobe has a central vein. Stalks: medium-short, thin, look like 
#       branches. Light coulored, many of them with crudely overpainted
#       dark splotches.
#     Flowers: several, medium-small, mostly upright, some drooping. 
#       Stalk: short, sometimes bent by weight.  Chalyx: rounded, light
#       colored, like a rose's but on the fat side.  Sepals: short and
#       pointed, light colored.  Petals: half a dozen, small,
#       tongue-shaped, spread out; dark overpaint almost but not
#       quite fills their outline.
#
#   One paragraph (5.5 lines) above the plant, left- and
#   right-justified.
#
# Comments:
#
#   The plant looks fairly normal, except for the fantastic
#   loop in the stalk.  Leaves and flowers are very naturalistic,
#   but some are spoiled by the crude dark overpaint.
